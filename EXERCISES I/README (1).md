1. Integers:

The code calculates statistics for the number of donors across multiple blood donation sessions (stored in a list).

Total donors: Sum of all session donations.

Average donors: Average number of donors per session.

Minimum and maximum donors: Finds the smallest and largest donor session numbers.

2. Strings (Formatted Report):

A string report is generated that summarizes the blood donation camp's total donors, average donors, and the range of donor numbers. The data is formatted nicely for display.

3. Booleans (Threshold Condition):

A condition checks if the average number of donors is above a threshold (50) and if the maximum donors in any session exceed 65. It prints a status message based on these conditions (either "Above Standard" or "Below Standard").

4. Lists:

A list of camp items is managed with operations:

Items are added (append()), removed (remove()), and sorted (sort()).

Specific conditions, like removing "Forms" if it exists, are applied.

5. Arrays:

An array (from the array module) is used to store donor data and compare it to a regular list.

The sum of donors is computed for both the array and the list and compared for equality.

6. Dictionaries:

A list of dictionaries stores donor information (name, id, and value of blood donated).

The code updates a specific donor's record (Ali’s donation) and deletes another donor’s record (Mary).

The total value of blood collected across all remaining donors is calculated.
